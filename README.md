## ðŸ“– Documentation

### Deploying to Netlify

-   In Netlify add two separate sites with "studio" / "web" as the base directories. The rest of the build settings is handled automatically (and by the `studio/netlify.toml` file).

-   You will need to add environment variables used in your .env files to Netlify as well.

### Sanity

-   API Access: You have to add all origins that should have access to your Sanity dataset (like http://localhost:3333 or your netlify url) the to the API settings in your [`Sanity Account`](https://manage.sanity.io)

-   To install updates for the Sanity studio:

    ```
    cd studio
    sanity upgrade
    cd ..
    pnpm i --shamefully-hoist
    ```

### Nuxt

To upgrade Nuxt 3 to the latest release, use the `npx nuxi upgrade` command.

To update manually: Bump `nuxt` dependency to the new version and then use `npx nuxi@latest cleanup` to cleanup any local caches.

### Preview Mode

#### Studio:

- All documents defined in `config/views.js` have a preview tab in the Studio
- The production urls for those documents are resolved with the `resolveProductionUrl` function in `config/views.js`
- The "Open preview" button in the studio context menu is defined in `sanity.config.js` using `resolveProductionUrl`
- The studio uses the `sanity-plugin-iframe-pane` to show the page inside a preview pane

#### Frontend:

- A separate Sanity client named `preview` is defined in `nuxt.config.js`. 
- You have to allow credentials for the frontend URL in your Sanity API settings to access unpublished data from Sanity.
- If the url contains the `preview` query, the `useSanityData` composable uses the preview client for fetching data
